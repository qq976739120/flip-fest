/*
	This project is addressing problem "New Standard: NFT metadata #16"
	The below code is untested and is meant as an illustration of the concept.
	
    The standard should
        fields are clear: any developer should comply, and browsers and other integrators can get the same type of data without any hassle
        very few restrictions: only abstract the common parts, whether they are needed for games, artwork or other projects
        easy to understand: standard contracts should not use complex design patterns and concepts, novice developers should also be able to understand and agree
        can be inherited: complex projects need to inherit this standard contract, and then it is easy to write their own extensions
